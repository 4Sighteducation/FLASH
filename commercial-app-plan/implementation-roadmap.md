## Technical Decisions

### State Management
```typescript
// Using Zustand for simplicity
interface AppState {
  user: User | null;
  flashcards: Flashcard[];
  studySessions: StudySession[];
  
  // Actions
  setUser: (user: User) => void;
  addFlashcard: (card: Flashcard) => void;
  updateStudySession: (session: StudySession) => void;
}
```

### Offline Support
```typescript
// Using React Query with persistence
const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      cacheTime: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24, // 24 hours
      staleTime: 1000 * 60 * 5, // 5 minutes
    },
  },
});

// Persist to AsyncStorage
const persistor = new AsyncStoragePersistor({
  storage: AsyncStorage,
  key: 'flashcards-cache',
});
```

### Performance Targets
- App launch: < 2 seconds
- Screen transitions: < 300ms
- Card flip animation: 60 FPS
- Offline mode: Full functionality
- Bundle size: < 40MB

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Performance on older devices**
   - Solution: Progressive enhancement
   - Fallback: Reduced animations

2. **Offline sync conflicts**
   - Solution: Last-write-wins with conflict UI
   - Fallback: Manual conflict resolution

3. **AI API costs**
   - Solution: Caching and rate limiting
   - Fallback: Basic templates

### Business Risks
1. **App store rejection**
   - Solution: Follow guidelines strictly
   - Fallback: Progressive web app

2. **Low conversion to premium**
   - Solution: A/B test pricing
   - Fallback: Ad-supported tier

3. **User acquisition**
   - Solution: Content marketing & SEO
   - Fallback: Paid acquisition channels

## Success Metrics

### Technical KPIs
- Crash-free rate: > 99.5%
- App store rating: > 4.5
- Load time: < 2s
- API response time: < 500ms

### Business KPIs
- Daily Active Users (DAU): 10k in 3 months
- Retention (D7): > 40%
- Premium conversion: > 5%
- Average session time: > 10 minutes

### User Engagement
- Cards studied per day: > 20
- Streak retention: > 30%
- Social shares: > 10%
- AI cards generated: > 50%

## Development Best Practices

### Code Quality
- TypeScript strict mode
- ESLint + Prettier
- Pre-commit hooks
- 80% test coverage
- Code reviews required

### Architecture Patterns
```typescript
// Feature-based folder structure
src/
  features/
    study/
      components/
      hooks/
      screens/
      services/
    gamification/
      components/
      hooks/
      screens/
      services/
```

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: Jest + React Testing Library
- Integration tests: Detox
- E2E tests: Critical user flows
- Performance tests: Flashlight
- Accessibility tests: Built-in tools

### Deployment Pipeline
```yaml
# CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Lint and type check
- Run tests
- Build for platforms
- Deploy to TestFlight/Play Console
- Notify team
```
