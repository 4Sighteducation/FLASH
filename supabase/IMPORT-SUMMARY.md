# FLASH App Curriculum Import - Complete Summary

## What We Accomplished

Successfully imported the complete curriculum hierarchy for your FLASH app:
- ✅ Schema verified as correct
- ✅ Import process tested with AQA A-Level Mathematics
- ✅ Created scripts for complete import of all subjects

## Import Structure

The curriculum follows a 3-level hierarchy:
1. **Modules** (Level 1) - Top level grouping
2. **Topics** (Level 2) - Main topic areas
3. **Sub Topics** (Level 3) - Detailed sub-topics

Note: Different exam boards use different terminology, but we standardized to this structure.

## Scripts Created

### Testing & Verification
- `COMPLETE-RESET-AND-START-OVER.sql` - Reset and recreate cleaned_topics
- `VERIFY-ENTIRE-SETUP.sql` - Verify schema correctness
- `FRESH-START-VERIFIED.sql` - Clean start with single subject test
- `CONTINUE-TEST-IMPORT.sql` - Complete test import for AQA Mathematics

### Complete Import
- `COMPLETE-IMPORT-ALL-SUBJECTS.sql` - Import all A-Level subjects
- `COMPLETE-IMPORT-GCSE.sql` - Import all GCSE subjects

### Debugging & Analysis
- `understand-data-model.sql` - Analyze data structure
- `DEBUG-GCSE-ISSUE.sql` - Debug duplication issues
- `check-current-state.sql` - Check database state
- `check-essential-counts.sql` - Quick status checks

## Import Process

1. Clear existing topics (preserving exam boards and subjects)
2. Import Level 1 (Modules) using DISTINCT to avoid duplicates
3. Import Level 2 (Topics) linked to their parent modules
4. Import Level 3 (Sub Topics) linked to their parent topics

## Key Learnings

- Each exam board has its own curriculum for subjects with the same name
- The import must properly link topics to the specific exam_board_subject combination
- Using DISTINCT is crucial to avoid duplicate entries from the CSV structure

## Next Steps

1. Run `COMPLETE-IMPORT-ALL-SUBJECTS.sql` section by section
2. Run `COMPLETE-IMPORT-GCSE.sql` section by section
3. Verify in your app that topics load correctly for each exam board/subject
4. Consider adding an AI prompt to better organize topics for exam boards with inconsistent structures

## Expected Results

- ~16,835 total curriculum items imported
- Topics correctly isolated by exam board
- Proper parent-child relationships maintained
- App should show topics when selecting any exam board → qualification → subject
