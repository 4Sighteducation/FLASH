# Simple Explanation - What We're Doing

## The Problem We Had
- Multiple exam boards have the same subjects (e.g., "Mathematics")
- Our old import was putting SQA Mathematics topics into AQA Mathematics, OCR Mathematics, etc.
- This created massive duplication (19,500 topics instead of 304!)

## The Fix
We now properly match BOTH:
1. The exam board (AQA, OCR, etc.)
2. The subject name

So SQA Mathematics topics ONLY go to SQA Mathematics subjects.

## The Process
1. **Test with smallest dataset first** (CCEA A-Level - 41 rows)
2. **Check it worked** - should see ~41 topics, not thousands
3. **If good**, continue with other exam boards
4. **Import in order** (smallest to largest) to catch any issues early

## Your Current Status
- ✅ CSV data loaded (16,835 rows in `cleaned_topics`)
- ✅ Exam board subjects already imported
- ⏳ Need to import curriculum topics (modules, topics, subtopics)

## Next Steps
1. Run the `SIMPLE-IMPORT-STEP-BY-STEP.sql` script
2. Start with just the CCEA section
3. Check the count - should be around 41
4. If it looks good, continue with other exam boards

## Files We Created
- `COMPLETE-RESET-AND-START-OVER.sql` - Reset everything (already done ✅)
- `SIMPLE-IMPORT-STEP-BY-STEP.sql` - The import script to run now
