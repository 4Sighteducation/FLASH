# FL4SH Domain Setup Guide
**Domains:** fl4shcards.com + fl4sh.cards  
**Vercel Project:** flash-gules (existing)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

We'll connect BOTH domains to your existing Vercel project:
- **fl4shcards.com** â†’ Primary marketing site
- **fl4sh.cards** â†’ Redirect to fl4shcards.com (short URL)

---

## Step 1: Commit & Deploy Marketing Site

First, let's get the marketing site live on Vercel:

```bash
# From FLASH root directory
cd "C:\Users\tonyd\OneDrive - 4Sight Education Ltd\Apps\FLASH"

# Commit all changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add Next.js marketing site with neon theme"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will auto-deploy! Check: https://flash-gules.vercel.app

---

## Step 2: Get DNS Records from Domain Registrar

### Where Did You Buy Your Domains?
- GoDaddy?
- Namecheap?
- Google Domains?
- Cloudflare?

**Let me know and I'll give you exact instructions!**

Generally, you need to:
1. Log into your domain registrar
2. Find "DNS Settings" or "Manage DNS"
3. We'll add records there

---

## Step 3: Add Domains in Vercel

### In Vercel Dashboard:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find project: **flash-gules**
3. Click on it
4. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Domains**

### Add Primary Domain (fl4shcards.com):

1. Click **"Add"**
2. Enter: `fl4shcards.com`
3. Click **"Add"**

Vercel will show you DNS records needed:

```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 76.76.21.21

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
```

### Add Redirect Domain (fl4sh.cards):

1. Click **"Add"** again
2. Enter: `fl4sh.cards`
3. Click **"Add"**

Vercel will show same DNS records for this domain too.

### Add Subdomain (for web app later):

1. Click **"Add"** again
2. Enter: `app.fl4shcards.com`
3. Click **"Add"**

```
Type: CNAME
Name: app
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
```

---

## Step 4: Configure DNS at Your Domain Registrar

### For fl4shcards.com:

**Add These Records:**

| Type  | Name/Host | Value/Points To        | TTL  |
|-------|-----------|------------------------|------|
| A     | @         | 76.76.21.21           | 3600 |
| CNAME | www       | cname.vercel-dns.com  | 3600 |
| CNAME | app       | cname.vercel-dns.com  | 3600 |

### For fl4sh.cards:

**Add These Records:**

| Type  | Name/Host | Value/Points To        | TTL  |
|-------|-----------|------------------------|------|
| A     | @         | 76.76.21.21           | 3600 |
| CNAME | www       | cname.vercel-dns.com  | 3600 |

---

## Step 5: Set fl4sh.cards to Redirect

**In Vercel Dashboard:**

1. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Domains**
2. Find `fl4sh.cards` in the list
3. Click the **three dots** (â€¢â€¢â€¢) next to it
4. Click **"Redirect to Domain"**
5. Enter: `fl4shcards.com`
6. Choose: **Permanent (308)**
7. Click **"Redirect"**

Now `fl4sh.cards` â†’ automatically redirects to `fl4shcards.com`!

---

## Step 6: Wait for DNS Propagation

**Timeline:** 5 minutes to 48 hours (usually 1-2 hours)

**Check Status:**
1. In Vercel dashboard, domains will show:
   - ðŸŸ¡ Pending (yellow) - DNS not propagated yet
   - ðŸŸ¢ Valid (green) - Working! âœ…

**Test Propagation:**
- Use: https://dnschecker.org
- Enter your domain
- Check if DNS has spread globally

---

## Step 7: Verify SSL Certificates

**Vercel automatically provisions SSL certificates!**

Once DNS is valid, Vercel will:
1. Auto-generate SSL certificate
2. Enable HTTPS
3. Force HTTPS redirect

Your site will be at:
- âœ… https://fl4shcards.com (secure!)
- âœ… https://fl4sh.cards â†’ redirects to fl4shcards.com
- âœ… https://app.fl4shcards.com (for later)
